Setup My PC v0.01


This is a README file that has within it all the changes I have made to this repo from the day it was made!

I have a problem with distro hopping and often need to set up a fresh PC however, the problem lay with setting up a new PC everytime was getting tedious.

Which is why I have made the effort of separating the setup process for both Linux and WIndows installs so I can install all the Software's that I need, AFAP!

Hopefully, this reduces the time it currently takes to setup my PC.

Thanks for reading!
